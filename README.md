# React-Simple-Calc


This is a 2 day sprint completed with Chris Pearson. We built a simple calculator that will use multiplication, division, addition and subtraction on a series of numbers. It will accept long expression input and will perform the operations in the expected order (BODMAS/BIDMAS).
There are no further frills!
